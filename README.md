# Slang Translator
## intro/inspiration
Are you ever browsing through the internet, when you find a new slang word. So you try to find the definition, but you get so many different results. This is a problem that me and @Josias at Hack
Club Slack faced. At this point, new slang is being created every single day. This is why I created
Slang Translator, a Chrome extension that streamlines the process of finding the definition of the
newest slang. 

## techincal stuff
I used the regular Chrome extension library to create the extension. I utilized the Urban Dictionary
API to find the actual definition to the slang. Please note that the definition will have bad 
words in it. 

## what's next for Slang Translator
In the future, I plan to use a different API that is more school-appropriate. Also, I will try to 
make the experience available to the other major browsers. 

## download
Download the project by installing all the files, going to chrome://extensions, enabling
developer mode, and by clicking "Load Unpackerd. This project will be available on the
Chrome Extension store soon.
